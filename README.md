# New Relic API Synthetics Boilerplate Examples
Some examples of how to use API Synthetics to make multiple requests.

- multiple-requests.js: This example shows how you can specify multiple API endpoints in configuration object and run them in one monitor.
- chained-requestst.js: This example shows how you can chain the output of one API call into the next.


## Installation
To test locally you need to run `npm install`. Running locally will mimick running in New Relic. See the local configuration block in the code to do anything fancy!
